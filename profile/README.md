# What #
GrinSync is an app for scheduling, finding, and tracking events happening in Grinnell. 

# Ideas #
Our idea is to create a platform that makes it easy for Grinnell students and community members to get accurate information about Grinnell events. We want student organizations to communicate with Grinnellians about their events, community members to more easily engage with the College, and students to plan what events they will attend based on their needs, interests, and schedule.
# Goals #

## Major features ##

- A comprehensive event calendar with all (or close to all) events going on at Grinnell College.
- The ability for users (those that are allowed to) to add and edit events in the event calendar.
- The ability for users to delete events that they have created from the event calendar.
- The ability for event adders to provide essential event details to an event, such as title, date, time, location, and a brief description of the event.
- A basic filtering scheme to allow users who are trying to discover events to categorize events in the event calendar by type (food is offered, pets are allowed, etc.).
- The ability for users to set preferences to tailor their event recommendations in the app. 
- Automated pulling of events from Grinnell College’s official calendar and Grinnell College Athletics’ calendar to GrinSync’s event calendar. 
- Some sort of GrinSync moderator to ensure the app is accurate (details to be fleshed out still). 
- Account creation for GrinSync users.
- Student organization leaders can link their account with the student org once they verify their identity. Verification must occur every semester. 

## Stretch goals ##

- Allowing users to select specific events/organizations to get notifications from.
- The option to edit an event after you post it and notify interested users about the changes in event details.
- Adding events to the Student User’s Outlook calendar.
- The option to provide an accessibility report of the event with information about: noise levels, accessible entrances, and the availabiliy of interpreters, for example.
