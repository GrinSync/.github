This is a general repository for general information on GrinSync (as the whole project). It is the place where you can find the organization's general README.md file (in the "profile" folder). You can also find our Sprint Planning Reports (in the "Sprint Planning Reports" folder) and Sprint Review Reports (in the "Sprint Review Reports" folder) in this repository.
