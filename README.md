# .github Repository
This is a general repository for general information on GrinSync (as the whole project). It is the place where you can find the organization's general README.md file (in the "profile" folder). You can also find our Sprint Planning Reports (in the "Sprint Planning Reports" folder) and Sprint Review Reports (in the "Sprint Review Reports" folder) in this repository.

## Repository Layout
- *Sprint Planning Reports*: The folder where all of our team's sprint planning reports will be.
- *Sprint Review Reports*: The folder where all of our team's sprint review reports will be.
- *profile*: The folder for our organization's profile. Currently, it only contains the README.md file that appears on our organization's home page. 
- *Documentation*: The folder for the documentation of our software. It contains a User Guide, Developer Guide, some Flutter Installation Help, and a Change Log and Release Notes (nothing in here as of Spring 2024 since we haven't released our app yet).
