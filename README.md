# .github Repository
This is a general repository for general information on GrinSync (as the whole project). It is the place where you can find the organization's general README.md file (in the "profile" folder). You can also find our Sprint Planning Reports (in the "Sprint Planning Reports" folder) and Sprint Review Reports (in the "Sprint Review Reports" folder) in this repository.

## Repository Layout
- *Sprint Planning Reports*: The folder where all of our team's sprint planning reports will be.
- *Sprint Review Reports*: The folder where all of our team's sprint review reports will be.
- *profile*: The folder for our organization's profile. Currently, it only contains the README.md file that appears on our organization's home page. 
- *Documentation*: The folder for the documentation of our software. It contains User Guide.md, Developer Guide.md, Help Menus and Tooltips.md, Changes and Release Notes.md.

## Operational Use Cases (so far)
- Ben creates an event by entering his event information in GrinSync (FEATURES NOT YET DONE FOR THIS USE CASE: repeating events option, associating student organization, picture upload - we may switch this to a stretch feature; as of now, we have the MVP for the event creation page - event title, location, date/time, description, event tags).
