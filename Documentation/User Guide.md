When users first open the app, they will be shown the Home page, which displays upcoming events open to the public. Users will initially be in the Guest mode of the app. Users in Guest mode can only view public events (i.e., not student-only events), and they cannot create events for the GrinSync calendar. Guest users will still be able to use the Search and Agenda pages, but only with public events. 

## Creating an account
You may access GrinSync as one of the following four roles: Grinnell College Student, Grinnell College Faculty Member, Community User, and Guest User. Guest users do not need to register; they just use the app as is without logging in or registering. 

Navigate to the Profile page (click the Profile button in the bottom navigation bar). Click on "Register". Register as whatever user you are by entering the requested information. 
If you try to Register with an email that is already in use or don't confirm your password correctly, you will receive an invalid credentials error when registering.

## Logging in
Navigate to the Profile page (click the Profile button in the bottom navigation bar). Click on "Login". Log in with your credentials. 
When Logging in, there is a “Forgot Password?” Button: this button is not currently functioning and will just do nothing when clicked.

## Logging out
When you try to log out by clicking the Logout button on the Profile page, you must switch to a different page by clicking on any button in the bottom navigation bar for the app to fully process your logout. 

## Navigating events on the Home page
Navigate to the Home page (click the Home button in the bottom navigation bar). Upcoming events will show. You can swipe down to refresh the page. You can click on various events to show their event details (event details page is still incomplete, however).

## My Agenda and Calendar View
Navigate to the Calendar page (click the Agenda button in the bottom navigation bar). 
### Views
There are monthly, weekly, and daily views of the calendar. You can switch views by clicking the three-dot symbol at the top of the page and selecting the view that you want. Currently, users cannot click on an event to view event details, yet. 
#### Daily 
This view will show the events on a time basis of the day that the user is on.
#### Weekly
This view will show a weekly view of the events for whichever week the user is on. Users can click on a specific day to get a daily view of that day.  
#### Monthly
This view shows the whole month. Dots indicate which days have events. Users can click on a specific day to get a daily view of that day (splits view with monthly view). 

## Creating events
Navigate to the Create Event page (click on the Create button in the bottom navigation bar). 
Enter information pertaining to the event. Information requested: 
- Title (type out)
- Location (type out)
- Start Date/Time (pick date and time in widget)
- End Date/Time (pick date and time in widget)
- Description (type out)
- Student-only event? (check box)
- Event tags (click on the button and select all tags that apply)

Creating an event while not logged in should show an “Event Creation Error” saying that GrinSync couldn’t create the event. This is because you need to be logged in as a student to add events to the calendar, currently.
Creating an event with missing required information (title, location, start time, end time) will show an “Event Creation Error” indicating you are missing information or have invalid input (in this case, you are missing information). 
Creating an event with an end time that is before the start time will show an “Event Creation Error” indicating you are missing information or have invalid input (in this case, you have invalid input).
