# User Guide
Welcome to GrinSync! Broadly, GrinSync is a mobile app that displays events happening on campus at Grinnell College and allows event organizers to advertise their Grinnell events. We are so glad you are interested in our app! Here, we will take you through the features of our app.

We will explain the main pages, as indicated by the icons and labels on the bottom navigation bar of the app. 

## Guest Mode
When users first open the app, they will be in the app's Guest mode. In Guest mode, users can only view public events (i.e., NOT student-only events). Other limitations of Guest mode are explained below. Guest mode allows users to discover Grinnell College events that are open to the public without requiring that they make a GrinSync account (e.g., visitors to the college may wish to use the app in Guest mode if their stay is only temporary).  
### Home Page - Guest Mode
When users first open the app, they are shown the Home page, which displays upcoming events (events happening at the current time to events starting a week from now) at Grinnell College that are open to the public. Users can pull down to refresh this page. Users can tap the filter icon in the top right corner, which will show how the events are filtered on the Home page. In Guest mode, the default event tags for filtering are all of the event tags possible in GrinSync, so when looking at the filtering options initially, all tags will be selected. Users can deselect and select whichever tags they wish to filter by on the Home page and apply the filters by pressing the "Apply Filters" button at the bottom. After, the Home page will refresh to only show events that contain the chosen filters. 
*Filtering Options*: In addition to selecting specific event tags, there are a few more filtering options users can apply. 
1. "Only show events with all tags selected": If users check this option, this means that only events that contain all tags that are currently selected will be shown on the Home page. For example, if the chosen tags are Art and Athletics, only events with both those tags will show.
2. "Revert to default tags": If users click this button, the tags selected will automatically revert back to the default tags. For Guest mode, the default tags are all of the event tags in GrinSync.
3. "Deselect all tags": If users click this button, all tags that are currently selected will become deselected.

In order for the filtering options to be applied on the Home page, the "Apply Filters" button must be pressed.
#### Event Details - Guest Mode
On the Home page, users can click on any event to view the event details. In the event details, users can see the host, location, start date-time, end date-time, description, and tags of an event. 

At times, there will be map information given in an event location. If there is map information, the location will have a blue pinpoint symbol next to it. Users can then click on the location, which will bring up the navigation to the event in their phones' default map app. If there is no blue pinpoint symbol next to the event location, clicking on the location will open Grinnell's interactive map on the Grinnell website on the users' browsers on their phones. 

If the host of an event is the Grinnell Calendar, clicking on the host name will open the official Grinnell calendar on the Grinnell website on the users' browsers on their phones. 

Additionally, at the bottom, there are three buttons:
1. "Add to Calendar": If users click this button, the current event they are viewing in GrinSync will become an event draft in the default calendar app of their phones.
2. "Contact Host": If users click this button, an email will be drafted to the event host's email in the default email app of their phones. The email itself is a generic email, indicating that the user is interested in the event, but users may change the email however they would like.
3. "Share Event": If users click this button, their phones' default share dialog pops up and allows users to share a pre-written description of the event (the dialog will vary depending on the phone, but usually, there are options to copy the text or send the text to someone via messages).

Users can press the help icon in the top right corner of the event details to see an explanation of the event details layout. Users can press the back arrow on the top left corner to return to the Home page. 
### Search Page - Guest Mode
On the Search page, users can search for events by event title or location. Users can click into the search bar, type their search query, and press the magnifying glass icon on the right to do the search. The search is NOT case-sensitive. Any event containing the searched text either in its title or location will show in the search results. For Guest mode, only events that are not marked as student-only will show in the search results. 
### Create Page - Guest Mode
In Guest mode, users cannot create events in GrinSync. This page will inform the user that they must be logged in to create events in GrinSync.
### Calendar Page - Guest Mode
In Guest mode, users cannot see the calendar view of events in GrinSync. This page will inform the user that they must be logged in to do so. 
### Profile Page - Guest Mode
On the Profile page, users in Guest mode will see two options: 1) Login and 2) Register. If users already have a GrinSync account, they can skip the next section and go the the "Logging in" section. 
 
## Creating an account
Users may access GrinSync as one of the following four roles: Grinnell College Student, Grinnell College Faculty Member, Community Member, and Guest User. 
Guest users do not need to register; they just use the app as is without logging in or registering (but they will have limitations in the app, as explained above). 
Between the other three user types, there are two main differences: 1) For Grinnell College students and faculty members, their emails must end in grinnell.edu and 2) Only Grinnell College students can view events that are specified as student-only. Everything else, in terms of the layout of the app, is the same across all user types. 

Navigate to the Profile page (click the Profile button in the bottom navigation bar). Click on the "Register" button. Register as whatever user type that user is by entering the requested information. 
If users try to Register with an email that is already in use or don't confirm their password correctly, they will receive a registration error when registering.
After filling out the fields, users can press the "Register" button at the bottom. An email will be sent to the email that was registered. Users must click the link in the email to confirm their GrinSync account before logging in (if they try to log in with an unconfirmed account, they will not be able to). 

## Logging in
Navigate to the Profile page (click the Profile button in the bottom navigation bar). Click on the "Login" button. Users can log in with their credentials (from when they registered). 
### Forgot Password?
On the Login page from above, there is a "Forgot Password?" button. Users can click this button if they forgot the password to their GrinSync account. Clicking on the button will open a web page that prompts users to enter the email of their GrinSync account. Once users do that, they will be sent an email from GrinSync. Users must click the link in that email, which will lead to another webpage that will allow users to reset their password. After clicking "Change Password" and seeing the confirmation of changing their password, users can go back to the GrinSync app and log in (as explained above). 

## Profile Page - Logged In
Users can access this page by clicking on the Profile button on the bottom navigation bar. 
### Logging out
On the Profile page, users can click on the "Logout" button at the bottom to log out. This action will log the users out and return them to Guest mode in the app. 
### Tag Preferences
When users click on this option, they will be led to the Tag Preferences page. On this page, there is a list of all the event tags in GrinSync. Users can select or deselect the checkboxes next to the tags to choose certain tags to be in their preferences. Whichever tags are chosen will become the user's default/preferred tags in GrinSync. On this page, users do not have to click a submit button. They simply need to choose the tags as they please, and the changes will occur automatically. For new users, there is a set of default tags that are pre-chosen for them. Of course, they may change these on this page if they would like. 
### Events I Created
When users click on this option, they will view a page with all of the events they created. They can click on the event to show the event details (event details while logged in are explained below). Also, if they don't want to click on the event details, they can do a small swipe to the left of the event card, and this will show options to edit or delete the event. If users do a large swipe to the left over the event card, the event will be deleted. 
### Events I Follow
When users click on this option, they will view a page with all of the events that they have liked/hearted (liking events explained below). They can click on the event to show the event details (event details while logged in are explained below). Also, users can swipe to the left of the event card to unlike the event. In order to see the changes on the Events I Follow page, however, users must press the backarrow at the top left of the page and click back into the Events I Follow. 
### Student Organizations I Follow
When users click on this option, they will view a page with all of the student organizations that they follow on GrinSync (following student organizations described below). Users can further click on a student organization to view the Student Organization Details page (explained below). 
### Student Organizations I Lead
When users click on this option, they will view a page with all of the student organizations that they are linked to at GrinSync (becoming a student organization leader described below).
### Create a Student Org
When users click on this option, they will be taken to a page in which they can create a student organization in GrinSync. Users will need to fill out the fields that are requested, click the "Create Org" button, and confirm the student organization account by following the instructions in the email that was sent to the student organization email. Users that create the student organization will automatically be connected to it (so the newly created student organization will be shown in the Student Organizations I Lead page, described above). 
### Connect to a Student Org
When users click on this option, they will be taken to a page in which they can choose a student organization to link to. On the page, they can click on the dropdown menu, choose the student organization, and click the "Connect to Org" button. This will send an email to the student organization email indicating that the user wants to become a student leader in GrinSync for the organization, and if they approve, they can confirm the connection. After the connection is confirmed, the user will be connected to the student organization (so the student organization will be shown on the Student Organizations I Lead page, described above). Users will use the Connect to Student Org option when their student organization already exists in GrinSync (if it doesn't, they can create the student organization as described above). 
### Feedback (Google Form)
When users click this option, a Google Form will pop up in their browser. This Google Form allows users to provide feedback to us, the GrinSync team. 

## Home Page - Logged In
The Home page when logged in works the same as the Home page in Guest mode (so see above for the full explanation) but with a few differences. 
1. When logged in, users will see a heart next to each event. They can click this heart icon to like/follow the event. The event will then show on the Events I Follow page on the Profile page. 
2. When clicking on the filter icon, the default tags for logged-in users will be the preferred tags that they specify in the Tag Preferences page.
3. For student users, there is an extra option in the filtering options called "Show students only events" that when checked off, will only show events that meet the filtering criteria and are student-only. 
### Event Details - Logged In
As in Guest mode, users can click on an event in the Home page and view the event details. The event details when logged in works the same as the event details in Guest mode but with a few additions for logged in users.
1. When logged in as a student, student-only events will have a little box next to the event title that labels the event as students only.
2. At the bottom, there is an added button labelled "Favorite Event" which, when clicked, will like the event and add the event to the user's Events I Follow page.
3. If the user is the event host for an event they are looking at, there are "Edit Event" and "Delete" options at the bottom of the event details. Clicking on the "Edit Event" button would lead users to an Edit Event page where they can submit changes to an event they created. Clicking on the "Delete" button would delete the event.
4. If the host is a student organization, users can click on the hostname, and they will be taken to a **Student Organization Details page**. This page will show the student organization name, email, GrinSync users connected to the student organization (i.e., the leaders), description of the student organization, and events in GrinSync created by the student organization. Users can only see this when logged in. 
### Following Student Organizations
At the bottom of the Student Organization Details page, there is a button that says "Follow". When pressed, this would make the user follow the student organization, and the student organization will show on the Student Organizations I Follow page on the Profile page. If the user is already following the student organization, the button will be an "Unfollow" option instead. 

## Create Page - Logged In
On the Create page, logged-in users can create an event in GrinSync.
Enter information about the event. The information requested: 
- Title (type out)
- Location (type out)
- Start Date/Time (pick date and time in popup)
- End Date/Time (pick date and time in popup)
- Description (type out)
- Repeating Event Customization (select an option)
  - None
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
- End Repeat (pick date if the repeating event option is not "None").
  - The end repeat date is inclusive, so the event will repeat on the end repeat date if applicable. 
- Student-only event? (check box; yes if the event is students only)
- Event tags (click on the button and select and submit all tags that apply to the event)

Title, location, start date/time, and end date/time are the only required fields.

At the bottom of the page, there is a "Reset All Fields" button that will clear all the fields on the Create page when pressed.

To submit the event, users can press the "Create Event" button at the bottom. Either a message saying that the event was created successfully will show, or there will be a message indicating there is an error (and the message will tell the reason why).

For users who are connected to student organizations, there will be an extra dropdown menu at the top of the Create page. Here, users can choose a student organization that they lead to be the host of the event if they want (as opposed to the user themself being the host). Users should only choose an option in the dropdown menu if they wish to create the event under a student organization. If no option is chosen for that dropdown, the event will be created under the user. 
### Editing Events
As mentioned previously, there are several ways to access the Edit Event page (through event details or the Events I Created page). The page itself is pretty straightforward and similar to the Create page. The fields will automatically be filled with the event information, and users can change the fields however they like and submit the changes by clicking the "Edit Event" button. A few technicalities for editing an event:
- As of right now, there is no way to change the repeating event customizations or the end repeat date for a repeating event (that's why there are no fields for those inputs on the Edit Event page).
- For users that are linked to student organizations, there is no way to switch the event host once the event is already created.
- Editing a repeating event will propagate the edits automatically to the event that was edited and all repeating events after it (but the events that are prior to the one edited remain unchanged).
- If an event is hosted by a student organization, any user linked to the student organization can edit the event. 
### Deleting Events
Similarly, as mentioned previously, there are several ways to access the deleting an event function (through event details or the Events I Created page). Once the delete option is pressed, the event should be deleted from GrinSync.
- Deleting a repeating event will delete the current event and all repeating events after it (but the events that are prior to the one that was deleted will stay).
- If an event is hosted by a student organization, any user linked to the student organization can delete the event. 

## Search Page - Logged In
The Search page while logged in works the same as the Search page in Guest mode, with the only exception being that if the logged-in user is a student user, the search results will also show any student-only events (this does not happen in Guest mode or for faculty and community users). In summary, users can search for events by event title or location. 

## Calendar Page - Logged In
The Calendar page shows GrinSync events in a typical calendar view (think of a generic calendar app on a phone).
### View Types
The calendar has three different types of views: 
1. By events you like (the user's liked events in Events I Follow)
2. By events you created (the user's created events in Events I Created)
3. By user preferences (only events that contain a tag that is in the user's preferred tags are set in the Tag Preferences page on the Profile page).
The default view is By events you like. For whichever view the user is in, they will only see those types of events in the calendar. Users can switch the type of view by clicking the filter icon in the top right corner and selecting whichever view they would like to see.
Users can view these different types of calendar views in different time formats. 
### Time Views
The default time view on the Calendar page is the Day view, and it will show the current day. A guide on how to navigate the Calendar page time views:
- On the top, users can click the three-dot symbol and select one of the three time views available: Day, Week, and Month.
  - Day: This view will show the events on a time basis of the day that the user is on.
  - Week: This view will show a weekly view of the events for whichever week the user is on. Users can click on a specific day to get a daily view of that day (this view can get quite crowded if there are a lot of events).
  - Month: This view shows the whole month that the user is currently on. Dots indicate which days have events. Users can click on a specific day to get a summary agenda of that day. 
- On the top of the page, users can use the arrows to switch to previous days/weeks/months (left arrow) and future days/weeks/months (right arrow) depending on which time view the user is in.
- The calendar icon at the top will revert the page back to the current day/week/month depending on which time view the user is in.
- Users can click the dropdown with the month and year label near the top left, which will bring up a date picker. If users pick a date, they will be taken to that day (if in Day view), week (if in Week view), or month (if in Month view).
- Users can switch to the Day view by clicking on a specific day while in the Week view.
- Users can view the summary agenda for each day by clicking on a specific date while in the Month view.
- If users click on an event in the calendar, they will see the event details for that event (the same as the event details accessed through the Home page).
  - If it is an event that the user created, they can delete the event or edit the event through the buttons on the event details.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q. How many events can I make at once?**

A. Once you create an event, you can go straight into creating another one! There is no limit to how many events you make. We just ask that you keep the events appropriate and accurate. There is be a GrinSync moderator who will delete spam events. 

**Q. How far in advance can I schedule an event?**

A. The latest date that you can schedule an event is January 1st, 2500. So, you can schedule events as far in advance up until that date. 

**Q. Is it possible to share my Calendar page with other people?**

A. GrinSync currently does not have a feature to do that. However, you can share events with other people. Our sharing feature creates a section of text that you can copy or share via messages. 
- Example: "Check out this event: Romancing Ruins at Burling Library - Print Study Room on 07:30 May 12, 2024"

**Q. If I edit a repeating event, is there a way to change only the event I choose and not have the changes made in all future events?**  

A. No, GrinSync does not currently have this feature. GrinSync will always propagate the changes to the current event and all repeating events after it. 

**Q. If I like an event, does it send me a reminder that the event is happening soon?**  

A. No, GrinSync does not currently push notifications to users.
