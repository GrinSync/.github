## Reproductions Steps
The error occurs on start-up, so simply running the program on the emulator in its current state causes the error.
## Hypothesis About The Bug
The bug occurs at start-up so I am thinking it is occuring during app initializationn, maybe in the main function that runs when the app is started. It could also be something on the main page, but usually this
returns an error on the page and not during initialization so I am leaning away from this idea.

4/27/2024, 6:32 pm: I think the error occured sometime in the last few commits, since the app was working for our demo on Wednesday. I'll look through the commits and see if I can find anything.
